h3. Minor changes

h4. API CheckoutsController

The Spree API now has support for "checking out" an order. This API functionality allows an existing order to be updated and advanced until it is in the complete state.

For instance, if you have an order in the "confirm" state that you would like to advance to the "complete" state, make the following request:

<shell>
PUT /api/checkouts/ORDER_NUMBER
</shell>

For more information on using the new CheckoutsController, please see the "Checkouts API Documentation":http://api.spreecommerce.com/v1/order/checkouts/.
