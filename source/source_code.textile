h2. Working with the Source Code

This guide covers obtaining and running the source code.  This is primarily for developers who are interested in contributing code to the Spree project or fixing the source code themselves.  It is not necessary to have a copy of the source code to run Spree.

h3. Git

The Spree source code is currently maintained in a "Git":http://git.or.cz/ repository. Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) and it allows us to do things never before possible with SVN. If you're skeptical of Git just remember how skeptical you were of SVN when you were using CVS. The differences are subtle but important and they are best understood by hands on use.

The authoritative git repository is hosted by "GitHub":http://github.com/ and is located "here":http://github.com/schof/spree/tree/master. You can clone the git repository using the following command:

<shell>
git clone git://github.com/schof/spree.git spree 
</shell>

INFO. If you are planning on contributing to Spree you should create a fork through Git Hub and initiate a pull request when you're done. (See the Contributors Guide for details.)

INFO. If the official GitHub repo is down you can try our mirror at "repo.or.cz":http://repo.or.cz

h4. Browsing the Repository and/or Downloading the Source Code

You can easily browse the repository through Git Hub's excellent "visual interface":http://github.com/schof/spree/tree/master. Git Hub also contains a link to download a tarball copy of the latest source code as well as links to "previous versions":http://github.com/schof/spree/downloads.

h4. Git on Windows

There are some well developed Git clients for Windows now. If you are on a Windows box you might want to check out the "msygit":http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ project. There is also a "screencast":http://gitcasts.com/posts/git-on-windows available.

h3. SVN

There are no immediate plans to support SVN clients. Given that most of the Rails world is moving to git (including the RoR project itself) maybe this is the time for you to jump on the bandwagon.

h3. Monitoring Changes in the Source

If you would like to keep up to date on changes to the source you can subscribe to the github "RSS":http://github.com/feeds/schof/commits/spree/master feed and you will be notified of all the commits.
