h3. Upgrade Considerations

h4. The important commands

+rake spree:upgrade+ 
will copy in any new "infrastructure" files, e.g. new configuration or javascript or 
style files. It saves you from needing to run the +spree+ command to get an empty project and then copying
changes across.

NOTE. currently this over-writes existing files, so be careful if you have experimental changes. (IDEA: use +-b+ flag on the copies? it does help)


h4. Dos and Don'ts

NOTE. Try to avoid modifying +config/boot.rb+ and +config/environment.rb+: use "initializers":#initializers instead.

h4. Tracking changes for over-ridden code

Be aware that core changes might have an impact on the components you have over-ridden in your project. 
You might need to patch your local copies, or ensure that such copies interact correctly with changed
code (e.g. using appropriate ids in Html to allow the javascript to work).

If you can help us to generalise the core code so that your preferred effect is achieved by altering 
a few parameters, then this is more useful than duplicating several files. Ideas and suggestions always
welcome.  

INFO. The "Spree Wiki":/wiki/scripts contains a few scripts to automate some of the checking.


h3. Initializers

Initializers are run during startup, and are the recommended way to execute certain settings.

NOTE. Initializers are run in alphabetical order. Most of the time this won't matter, but you probably want your site initializer to run last. I call mine +zzzzzzz.rb+. 

NOTE. At the moment, initializers in extensions are ignored (but we are looking at this). For now, still put initializers in their extensions but use symbolic links in +config/initializers+ to point to them. 



h3. Debugging techniques

h4. Use tests!

Use +rake spec+ to test basic functioning after you've made changes.


h4. Analysing crashes on a non-local machine

If you're testing on a server, whether in production or development mode, the following code in one
of your +FOO_extension.rb+ files might save some time. It triggers local behaviour for users who have
an admin role. One useful consequence is that uncaught exceptions will show the detailed error page
instead of +404.html+, so you don't have to hunt through the server logs. 

<shell>
Spree::BaseController.class_eval do
  def local_request?
    ENV["RAILS_ENV] != "production" || current_user.present? && current_user.has_role?(:admin)
  end
end
</shell>

h3. Managing large projects

h4. Setting up submodules

Some of us use "Git submodules":http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSubmoduleTutorial
to tie large projects together: the basic Spree shell plus the 
+site/+ extension is the main repository, and everything else is loaded in as a submodule, 
including Spree itself. See "this Spree-demo fork":http://github.com/paulcc/spree-demo/tree
for an example. 

The basic command to set up a submodule is this. Call it for each of the submodules you need.
For Spree, you want to use the path +vendor/spree+.

<shell>
git submodule add some_repo [-b branch] vendor/extension/some_ext
</shell>

If your project is public, then you probably want to give the public version of your repo so
other people can use it without change. When I need to change a submodule in place, I add a
new remote with the proper url for changes to be pushed to. 
The branch option is recommended (and you probably want to specify "master" most of the time).

h4. Checking out submodules

On the first run, the following command fetches the submodule repositories into the nominated 
directories.
<shell>
git submodule update --init
</shell>


h4. Managing submodules

+git submodule foreach+ is very useful for managing your submodules, e.g. you can update all of them
with +git submodule foreach "git pull"+, or check for modifications with 
+git submodule foreach "git status || echo ok"+ (the +echo ok+ gets round a return-code issue). 

When pushing modifications, remember to check each of your repositories (with +foreach+ above),
and then check in the main repository. Git tracks the last commit in each submodule and includes
this information in the main repository, hence allowing the right versions to be checked out 
later.
