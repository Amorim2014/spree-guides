h2. Spree 1.0 Release Notes

endprologue.

h3. Summary

This is the official 1.0 Release of Spree. This is a *major* release for Spree, and so backwards compatibility with extensions and applications is not maintained.

The changes to Spree in the 1.0 Release are outlined in this document.

h3. Namespacing

h3. Preferences

We have refactored Spree Preferences to improve performance and simplify
code for applications and extensions. The previous interfaces have been
maintained so no code changes should be required. The underlying classes
have been completely rewritten.

Please see the "Spree blog":http://spreecommerce.com/blog/2011/12/04/spree-preferences-refactor for
notes on this release.

h3. Deprecated functions

h4. Product

+master_price+, +master_price=+, +variants?+, +variant+ are now officially retired. Please use +Product.price+, +Product.price=+, +Product.has_variants?+ and +Product.master+ respectively instead.

h4. Spree::Config[:stylesheets]

+Spree::Config[:stylesheets]+ and +stylesheet_tags+ are removed in favor for the Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline. See the "Asset Customization":asset_customization.html for more information.

Extensions looking to add stylesheets to the application should do so through the Asset Pipeline by making the extension an engine.

h3. Testing

h4. The demise of Cucumber testing

Cucumber is a great testing tool however it doesn't bring more values for tesing but overhead. It is decide to opt for a light-weight practice of RSpec + Capybara.
