h3. Summary

This is the official 1.0 Release of Spree

h3. Preferences

We have refactored Spree Preferences to improve performance and simplify
code for applicaitons and extensions. The previous interfaces have been
maintained so no code changes should be required. The underlying classes
have been completely rewritten.

Please see the "Spree blog":http://spreecommerce.com/blog/2011/12/04/spree-preferences-refactor for
notes on this release

h3. Deprecated functions

h4. Product

+master_price+, +master_price=+, +variants?+, +variant+ are now officially retired. Please use +Product.price+, +Product.price=+, +Product.has_variants?+ and +Product.master+ consecutively instead.

h4. Spree::Config[:stylesheets]

+Spree::Config[:stylesheets]+ and +stylesheet_tags+ are removed in favor for the Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline. See the "Asset Customization":asset_customization.html for more information.
