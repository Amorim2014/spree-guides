h4. Sample product images in extensions

For some time now you've been able to write sample data fixtures in extensions
that will get run when you load sample data with the +rake db:bootstrap+ task.

Now you can also add sample product image files in your extensions in the 
extensions own +lib/tasks/sample/products+ directory.  These images will be 
copied to the +public/assets/products+ directory when the sample data is loaded.
