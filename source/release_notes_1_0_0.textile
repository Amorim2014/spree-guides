h3. Summary

This is the official 1.0 Release of Spree

h3. Preferences

We have refactored Spree Preferences to improve performance and simplify
code for applicaitons and extensions. The previous interfaces have been
maintained so no code changes should be required. The underlying classes
have been completely rewritten.

Please see the "Spree blog":http://spreecommerce.com/blog/2011/12/04/spree-preferences-refactor for
notes on this release
