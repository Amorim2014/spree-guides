h3. S3 Support

To configure Spree to upload images to S3, put these lines into +config/initializers/spree.rb+:

<ruby>
Spree.config do |config|
  config.use_s3 = true
  config.s3_bucket = '<bucket>'
  config.s3_access_key = "<key>"
  config.s3_secret = "<secret>"
end
</ruby>

It's also a good idea to not include the +rails_root+ path inside the +attachment_path+ configuration option, which by default is this:

<ruby>
:rails_root/public/spree/products/:id/:style/:basename.:extension
</ruby>

To change, this add this line underneath the +s3_secret+ configuration setting:

<ruby>
config.attachment_path = '/spree/products/:id/:style/:basename.:extension'
</ruby>

If you're using the Western Europe S3 server, you will need to set two additional options inside this block:

<ruby>
Spree.config do |config|
  ...
  config.attachment_url = ":s3_eu_url"
  config.s3_host_alias = "s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"
end
</ruby>

And additionally you will need to tell paperclip how to construct the URLs for your images by placing this code outside the +config+ block inside +config/initializers/spree.rb+:

<ruby>
Paperclip.interpolates(:s3_eu_url) do |attachment, style|
  "#{attachment.s3_protocol}://#{Spree::Config[:s3_host_alias]}/#{attachment.bucket_name}/#{attachment.path(style).gsub(%r{^/}, "")}"
end
</ruby>
