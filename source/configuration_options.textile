h3. Shipping

h4. Spree::Config[:shipping_instructions]

The option Spree::Config[:shipping_instructions] controls collection of additional shipping instructions. This is turned off by default. If an order has any shipping instructions attached, they will be shown in an orderâ€™s shipment admin page and can also be edited at that stage. Observe that instructions are currently attached to the order and not to actual shipments.
