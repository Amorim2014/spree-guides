h2. Shipping

This section explains how Spree represents shipping options and how it calculates 
expected costs, and shows how you can configure the system with your own shipping 
methods.
After reading it you should know:
* the design used in Spree
* how to specify your shipping structure
* how to configure products for special shipping treatment
* how to capture shipping instructions

h3. Overview

Spree uses a very flexible and effective system to calculate shipping, accomodating
the full range of shippment pricing: from simple flat rate to complex product-type and 
weight dependent calculations.

Explaining each piece separately and how they fit together can be a cumbersome task.
Fortunately, using a few simple examples makes it much easier to grasp.

In that spirit, the examples are shown first in this guide.

h3. Examples

h4. Simple setup

Consider you sell t-shirts to US and Europe

And you work with 2 deliverers:
* USPS Ground (to US)
* FedEx (to EU)

And their pricing is as follow:

* USPS charges $5 for one t-shirt and $2 for each additional one
* FedEx charges $10 each, regardless of the quantity

To achieve this setup you need the following configuration:

* Shipping Categories: All your products are the same, so you don't need any.
* 2 Shipping Methods (Configuration->Shipping Methods):

|Name|Zone|Calculator|
|USPS Ground|US|Flexi Rate($5,$2)|
|FedEx|EU_VAT|FlatRate-per-item($10)|

h4. Advanced setup

Consider you sell products to a single zone (US)

And you work with 3 deliverers (Shipping Methods):
* FedEx
* DHL
* US postal service.

And your products can be classified into 3 Shipping Categories:
* Light
* Regular
* Heavy

And their pricing is as follow:

FedEx charges:
* $10 for all light items regardles of how many you have
* $2 per regular item
* $20 for first heavy item and $15 for each next one.

DHL charges:
* $5 per item if it's light or regular
* $50 per item if it's heavy.

US Postal Service always charge based on the package weight.

To achieve this setup you need the following Calculators mapping
(Configuration->Shipping Rates):

|~S.Category~ \ ^S.Method^|*DHL*|*FedEx*|*USPS*|
|_Default (*)_|Per Item($5)|-|Weight Bucket|
|*Light*|-|Flat Rate($10)|-|
|*Regular*|-|Per Item($2)|-|
|*Heavy*|Per Item($50)|Flexi Rate($20,$15)|-|

p. (*) The default calcultor is the one defined on the Shipping Method 
configuration (Configuration->Shipping Methods) and it's used when no 
mapping exists for a specific Shipping Category &#8596; Shipping Method pair.


For US Postal Service we define only the default calculator for shipping
method, since we don't care about shipping category, and we assign it
a custom calculator.


h3. Design and functionality

To properly leverage Spree's shipping system's flexibility you must
understand a few key concepts:

* Shipping Methods
* Zones
* Shipping Categories
* Calculators (through Shipping Rates)

h4. Shipping Methods

Shipping methods are the actual service used to send the product.  
For example:
* UPS Ground
* UPS One Day
* FedEx 2Day
* FedEx Overnight
* DHL International

Each shipping method is only applicable to an specific Zone as, for example, you can't ship internationally using a local postal service.

Ie. you can't ship from Dallas, USA to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil using UPS Ground.

h4. Zones

Zones serve as a mechanism for grouping geographic areas together into a single entity.
You can read all about how to configure and use Zones in the "Zones Guide":zones.html

The Shipping Address entered during checkout will define the zone the customer is in
and limit the Shipping Methods available to him.

h4. Shipping Category

Shipping category is useful if you sell products whose shipping pricing varies greatly (TVs and Mugs, for instance).

bq. For simple setups, where shipping for all products are priced the same (ie. t-shirt only shop), there is no need to setup categories.

p. An example of Shipping Categories would be:
* light
* regular
* heavy

Shipping Categories are created in the admin interface (Configuration -> Shipping Categories) and then assigned to products (Products->Products->edit->Product Details pane).

During checkout, the shipping category of the product will determine which calculator will be used to price its shipping for each Shipping Method.

h4. Calculators

A calculator is the component responsible for calculating the shipping price for each available Shipment Method.

Spree ships with 4 default calculators:
* Flat rate (per order)
* Flat rate (per item/product)
* Flat percent
* Flexible rate

bq. Flexible rate: Flat rate for the first product + Flat rate for each additional product.

You can define your own calculator if you have more complex needs. In that case, check out the "Calculators Guide":calculators.html

h3. UI

h4. What the Customer Sees

In the standard system, there is no mention of shipping until the 
checkout phase.

After entering a shipping address, the system displays
the available shipping options and their costs for the whole order.

Only the shipping options whose zones include the _shipping_ address 
are presented. 

The Customer must choose one before proceeding to the next stage. At 
confirmation, the shipping cost has been added to the order total.

NOTE. You can enable collection of extra _shipping instructions_ by setting the option +Spree::Config.set(:shipping_instructions => true)+. This is turned off by default. See "Shipping Instructions":#shipping-instructions below.

h4. What the Orders Administrator Sees

A shipment object is created at checkout time for the order. Initially it 
records just the shipping method and the order it applies to. The administrator
can update the record with actual shipping cost and a tracking code, and 
may also (once only) confirm the dispatch. This confirmation causes a
shipping date to be set as the time of confirmation. 


h3. Advanced Shipping Methods

The main work is to provide a suitable calculator. If the calculators that
comes with Spree are not enough for your needs, you might want to use an
extension, if one exists, or create a custom one.


h4. Extensions

There are a few Spree extensions which provides additional shipping methods, including
special support for the fees for common carriers, or support for bulk orders.
See the "Spree Extension Registry":http://ext.spreecommerce.com for the latest 
information.

h4. Writing your own

For more detailed information, check out the "Calculators Guide":calculators.html

Your calculator should accept an Array of LineItems and return a cost.
It can look at any reachable data, but typically uses the address, the order and the 
information from variants which are contained in the line_items.

h3. Product Configuration

Users can assign products to specific ShippingCategories or include extra information in 
variants to enable the calculator to determine results.

Each product has an (optional) +ShippingCategory+: this adds product-specific information
to the calculations beyond the standard information from the shipment (which is
destination address, variants and quantities, and possibly some weight and dimension 
information if given for a variant). +ShippingCategory+ is basically a wrapper for
a string. One use is to code up specific rates, eg "Fixed $20" or "Fixed $40", from 
which a calculator could extract imposed prices (and not go through its other
calculations).

h4. Variant configuration

Variants can be specified with weight and dimension information. Some shipping method
calculators will use this information if it is present. 

h3. Shipping Instructions

The option +Spree::Config[:shipping_instructions]+ controls collection of additional
_shipping instructions_. This is turned off by default. If an order has any shipping
instructions attached, they will be shown in an order's shipment admin page and can
also be edited at that stage. Observe that instructions are currently attached to
the order and not to actual shipments.
