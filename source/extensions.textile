h2. Extensions

This guide covers the use of extensions and their role in customizing and enhancing the standard Spree installation.  After reading this guide you should learn:

* The role extensions play in a Spree deployment
* How to build a "site" extension to customize the look and feel of your store
* How to write a custom extension
* Where to find existing extensions

endprologue.

h3. Overview

Spree supports a powerful extension mechanism.  This allows us to focus on our mission of building a solid foundation that addresses 90% of the commerce problem.  Extensions address the remaining 10%.  Extensions provide a logical and consistent way for Spree users to supply any missing functionality in their application.  Extensions are designed in a way that should be highly intuitive to the experienced Rails programmer.  They also provide a convenient way for users to develop and share extensions with other members of the Spree community.

The Spree extension mechanism was based extensively on the work of the "Radiant":http://radiantcms.org community.  The Radiant CMS project has a very similar design philosophy ("no fluff") and has already solved the problem in a very elegant fashion.

h3. Overriding the Spree Defaults

Custom extensions should be placed in the @vendor/extensions@ directory of your project.  Extensions placed in this directory will be automatically available to your application. What does an extension allow you to customize?  The short answer is pretty much everything.

* Models
* Views
* Controllers
* Routes
* Migrations
* Rake tasks

Some of the more obvious possibilities would be to override the default view or controller used by Spree.  Most stores will need to customize the UI and you can use extensions to do this.  You can also use an extension to mixin functionality into an existing controller or view.  Since extensions have their own migrations you can modify existing Spree tables or create new ones in your database. The possibilities are almost endless.

h3. Directory Structure

Extensions have a directory structure that should look very familiar to you.  They follow essentially the same layout as a standard Rails app.  
<shell>
app
  controllers
  helpers
  models
  views
config
db
  migrate
lib
spec
  controllers
  helpers
  models
  spec.opts
  spec_helper
  views
</shell>

So even though your Spree application will not have an +app+ directory, your extensions will.  If your primary goal is to simply customize Spree for a specific business then you could just create a single extension and put all of your custom stuff in there.  If you would like to reuse stuff between your own projects, or even share them with the Spree community, then you will want to organize your work logically into multiple self-contained extensions. 

h3. Site Extension

When you use the +spree+ command to create a new application, it will automatically create a +site+ extension for you.  This is where you should put all of the code to customize your site views, etc. This is essentially what you would normally put into the +app+ directory of a standard Rails application.  It may seem a little bit strange to put this type of content into an extension (as opposed to a top level directory) but this process makes upgrading to newer versions of Spree considerably easier.

Technically there is nothing special about the site extension.  It is just a naming convention.  Every Spree application will likely need one so we have come up with a standard name for this concept.  You could call this extension whatever you wish.  You could also break the contents of the site extension into as many extensions as you wish (although there aren't many usecases for this.)

h3. I18n

Extensions can be used to provide custom locales for your extension.  For instance, if you wanted to use the +en-GB+ locale but there were a few translations that you disagreed with and wanted to change.  You could createa a new locale called +en-GB-custom+ and start by copying over the existing locale files.  

<shell>
app
config
  locales
    en-GB-custom.yml
    en-GB-custom_rails.yml
db
lib
spec
</shell>

Suppose you wanted to change the appearance of the term "City / Town" to "Hamlet."  Simply edit your custom locale file in your extension as follows

<shell>
...
city: Hamlet  
...
</shell>  

Typically you would save your custom locales in the site extension but you might also want to create it as its own extension if you were planning on building more then one Spree store and you wished to reuse your custom locale.

INFO. If there is a translation error or missing translation information in one of the existing Spree locales, you should fork the Spree project in GitHub and provide a patch.  See "contributing to spree":contributing_to_spree.html for more details.

h3. Tutorial

There is a very detailed [[Extension_tutorial|extensions tutorial]] that will explain how to create your own extensions.

h3. Available Extensions

There are numerous extensions that have been written for Spree.  We've attempted to consolidate the list of known extensions on the [[extensions_listing|Extensions Listing]] page for your convenience.  You can also do a general search for extensions in "GitHub":http://github.com.  Be sure to type @spree fork:false@ in the search box to refine your search to exclude all of the spree forks.

h3. Tips and Tricks

h3. Adding Fields to Product or Variants

You may be interested in adding one or more fields to variant and / or product models using an extension. The Variant model has a class method called additional_fields which exposes an array of additional fields, which you can add to from your extension to provide any extra fields that you might need. See [[See adding fields from extensions]] for more details.

h3. Extension Migrations

Extensions have a special migration script (@script/generate extension_migration <extension_name> <migration_name>@) that allows you to add migrations with the appropriate timestamp to your extension.

h3. Modifying the Checkout Workflow

Its possible for an extension to modify the state machine used to model the checkout process.  One example of how this is done can be found in the @shipping@ extensions that ships with Spree.  This extension basically changes the default flow of address -> payment to address -> shipping -> payment.

<shell>
Order.state_machines['state'].events['next'].transitions.delete_if { |t| t.options[:to] == "creditcard_payment" && t.options[:from] == "address" }
Order.state_machines['state'].events['next'].transition(:to => 'shipment', :from => 'address')
Order.state_machines['state'].events['next'].transition(:to => 'creditcard_payment', :from => 'shipment')
Order.state_machines['state'].events['previous'].transition(:to => 'address', :from => 'shipment')
Order.state_machines['state'].after_transition :to => 'shipment', :do => :before_shipment
Order.state_machines['state'].events['edit'].transition(:to => 'in_progress', :from => 'shipment')
</shell>

New steps in the checkout process should always add an @edit@ transition so that the "view cart" link will continue to function properly.

h3. Using Migrations for Custom Configurations

Spree comes with all sorts of default configurations that you will likely want to customize.  Many of these values can be changed now through admin screens (those that can't be changed will be able to shortly once those screens are written.)  Once a preference is changed from its default, the value is stored in the database.

It is possible to use a migration to setup these preferences so that you can set the preferences of your site automatically.  This is handy when migrating a new series of configurations from a tested development environment to production.  You no longer have to remember to manually change these settings, just run the migrations like normal.

For example, the default country in Spree is United States.  If you wanted the default country to be Ireland you could add the following to your site extension:

<shell>
class AddCustomConfigurations < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    Spree::Config.set(:default_country_id => 96)
  end

  def self.down
  end
end
</shell>


h3. Defining which extensions will be loaded and their order

In the environment.rb inside the initializer block put something like this:
<shell>
config.extensions = [:all, :site]
</shell>

Where :all means all extensions available and not specified in that array. Those "all" extensions will follow a predefined order then, first Spree's internal extensions will be loaded in alphabetical order then external extensions will be loaded in alphabetical order.

You can even make something be loaded first too:
<shell>
config.extensions = [:first_extension, :all, :site]
</shell>
