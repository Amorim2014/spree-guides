h3. Changes to the REST API

Spree 0.40.x introduces several minor but important changes to the REST API.  If you are currently relying on the API you should be aware of a few important changes.  Please also consult the detailed "REST Guide":/rest.html for more details.

h4. New Authentication Mechanism

The most significant change to the REST API is related to authentication.  The recent adoption of "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise for authentication in general has resulted in new opportunities to improve authentication for the API specifically.

Prior to Spree 0.40.x the old method of authentication was to pass an authentication token in the header.  This involved using the specially designated +X-SpreeAPIKey+ header and passing a corresponding token value.  The new approach is to use standard +HTTP_AUTHORIZATION+ which is already nicely implemented by Devise.

If you were using curl you could achieve this authentication as follows:

<shell>
curl -u V8WPYgRdSZN1mSQG17sK:x /
http://example.com/api/orders.json
</shell>

Note that we are using the token as the "user name" and passing "x" as a password here.  There is nothing special about "x", its just a placeholder since many HTTP Basic Authentication implementations require a password to be submitted.  In our case the token is sufficient so we use a placeholder for the password.

h4. Support for +.json+ Suffix

It is now recommended that you consider using a +.json+ suffic in your URL when communicating via the REST API.  This is technically not a new feature - it was always possible in older versions of the REST API.  We've updated the documentation to suggest this simpler apporach (which avoids the necessity of passing +Accept:application/json+ in the header.)

<shell>
curl -u V8WPYgRdSZN1mSQG17sK:x http://example.com/api/orders.json
</shell>
