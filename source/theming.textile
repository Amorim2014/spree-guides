h3. Creating the Theme Extension

Themes in Spree are implemented as "Extensions":extension_tutorial.html

h4. MyTheme Extension with Spree Application

First, to generate the extension, run the following to create an extension by the name of 'MyTheme'.

<shell>
script/generate extension my_theme
</shell>

h4. Load order

Each extension loaded by Spree will override the views and styleshets of those that preceed so you will need to configure their load order. Put something like the following inside the initializer block in the file +config/environment.rb+:

<shell>
config.extensions = [:all, :my_theme, :site]
</shell>



This command will create many files in the vendor/extensions/site/ directory that looks similar to a generic rails application.

h3. Stylesheets

This part of the tutorial explains how to add a custom stylesheet to spree to change the look of your site.

h4. Overriding Spree's stylesheets

h5. Less CSS

Spree uses "Less CSS":http://lesscss.org/ for its CSS. This adds features such as variables and mixins to CSS while still supporting standard CSS syntax. 

Stylesheets are created in app/stylesheets with the extension ".less" and are then compiled into ".css" files automatically.

Spree has a number of stylesheets for the from end of the site which are all compiled to the single file "screen.css" to improve site performance. These files are as follows:

<shell>
  _buttons.less
  _cart.less
  _checkout_progress.less
  _checkout.less
  _colors.less
  _forms.less
  _layout.less
  _messages.less
  _mixins.less
  _navigation.less
  _prices.less
  _product_details.less
  _product_lists.less
  _registration.less
  _reset.less
  _typography.less
  screen.less
</shell>

The "_" file prefix denotes a partial stylesheet. These are all included into the main stylesheet "screen.less" on compilation using the @import directive:

<shell>
  @import "_reset";
</shell>

To override any of these stylesheets, create a file of the same name within your extensions +app/stylesheets+ directory.

h4. Custom stylesheets

By default Spree will only load +/stylesheets/screen.css+ into the main layout. Rather than override the layout template you can load your custom stylesheet by editing +SITE_EXTENSION_DIR/my_theme_extension.rb+ and changing  the existing +activate+ method to the following:

<code>
def activate
  AppConfiguration.class_eval do
    preference :stylesheets, :string, :default => 'screen,my_theme'
  end
end
</code>

This would load screen.css first followed by my_theme.css.
