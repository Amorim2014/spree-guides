## Overview

The SpreeCommerce hub configuration tool is designed to make managing your Spree integrations quick and painless. It is what handles communication between your storefront and the SpreeCommerce hub itself.

In addition to allowing you to [configure](configuration) your integrations, it also provides functionality that let's you inspect your message queues and view any generated [notifications](notification_messages) from the hub.

***
This guide assumes you already have the SpreeCommerce hub configuration tool configured for your Spree storefront. For more information on configuring the hub configuration tool, please view the [configuration](configuration) guide.

## Message Queues

This section explains how to view messages in the incoming, accepted and archived queues. For more information on messages in general, please view the [messages section](overview#messages) of the [overview guide](overview).

### Viewing Message Queues

When on the  integration overview screen of the "Integration" tab of your storefront's backend, you will see three options that allow you to view the different message queues:

* Click on "View Incoming Messages" to view the incoming queue
* Click on "View Accepted Messages" to view the accepted queue
* Click on "View Archived Messages" to view the archived queue

Once selecting a queue to view, you will see a listing of all the messages in that queue:

You can filter the messages listing using the dropdowns and inputs above the listing. The following filter options are available:

* Filter by state
* Filter by messages
* Filter by consumer
* Filter by date range

To inspect a message in more detail, click on the "eye" icon to the right of a message.

### Inspecting Messages

Once selecting a message to view, you will be taken to a view similar to the one shown above. This view allows you to inspect the following attributes by clicking on the links on the right side of the screen:

* Children - A list of messages the current message is a parent of.
* Notifications - Any notifications associated with this message.
* Last Error - The last error message associated with this message, if one exists.
* Result - The response from the endpoint.
* Attributes - All attributes of the current message.
* Payload - The payload contains all message-specific details. For example, in the case of `order:new` it would contains order details.

If you are viewing a message in the accepted queue that has errors present, you can retry the message by clicking on the "Rocket Ship" icon. You can also archive accepted messages by clicking on the "Filing" icon.
