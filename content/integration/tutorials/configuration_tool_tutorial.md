## Introduction

The Spree Integrator Configuration tool is designed to make managing your Spree integrations quick and painless. Installing the tool is a simple matter of adding one line to your product's `Gemfile`, and running two commands. Once that is done, you can manage your own third-party service integrations on the fly.
